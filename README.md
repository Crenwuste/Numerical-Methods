This repository contains solutions for multiple computational, numerical, and data-driven projects implemented MATLAB. The projects are grouped into six main categories.

## 1. Markov is coming
- Loads labyrinths, constructs adjacency and transition matrices.
- Solves linear systems using Jacobi iteration.
- Finds paths using greedy search.
- Converts state vectors into coordinate paths.

## 2. Linear Regression
- Loads and preprocesses datasets.
- Converts categorical data to numerical format.
- Implements linear regression with gradient descent and normal equation.
- Supports L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.

## 3. MNIST 101
- Loads and splits MNIST dataset into training and test sets.
- Initializes network weights.
- Implements forward and backward propagation with regularization.
- Generates predictions from trained network.

## 4. Numerical Music
- Converts stereo audio to mono.
- Computes spectrograms.
- Generates sinusoidal signals with ADSR envelopes.
- Applies high-pass filtering and reverb effects.

## 5. Robotzii
- Reads and processes input data.
- Performs cubic spline interpolation and polynomial interpolation (Vandermonde).
- Evaluates interpolated values for given points.

## 6. Recommendations
- Loads and preprocesses rating matrices.
- Computes cosine similarity between vectors.
- Generates recommendations using SVD and similarity scores.
